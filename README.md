This project is part of my research project, which aims to investigates the physical properties (including: redshift, distance, radius, and mass), membership, and density distribution of the cluster to better understand its structural and dynamic characteristics.

Membership determination was conducted using two primary methods: the Bukhari & Cram method and the Color Cut method. The Bukhari & Cram Method is a member determination technique that iteratively evaluates membership based on radial velocity and projected distance in the central region. The process is then expanded by increasing the values of Sr and Sv by 10%, ensuring that the new Sr and Sv values are less than the previous ones. Meanwhile, the Color Cut Method determines its member based on the relationship between color and magnitude using the color cuts g-r, r-i, and i-z. The bin size for the color cuts g-r, r-i, and i-z is 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1. The use of two different methods is expected to minimize errors and increase the accuracy of the property determination results of galaxy cluster. 

Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied as an experimental approach to evaluate whether this technique could be effectively used for galaxy cluster membership identification, offering potential for future advancements in cluster analysis methods.
