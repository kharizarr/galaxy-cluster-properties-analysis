This project is part of my research project, which aims to determine galaxy cluster members using 2 methods, Bukhari & Cram Method and Color Cut Method.

The Bukhari & Cram Method is a member determination technique that iteratively evaluates membership based on radial velocity and projected distance in the central region. The process is then expanded by increasing the values of Sr and Sv by 10%, ensuring that the new Sr and Sv values are less than the previous ones. Meanwhile, the Color Cut Method determines its member based on the relationship between color and magnitude using the color cuts g-r, r-i, and i-z. The bin size for the color cuts g-r, r-i, and i-z is 0.2, 0.1, and 0.1. The use of two different methods is expected to minimize errors and increase the accuracy of the property determination results of galaxy cluster.
