This project is part of my research project, which aims to determine galaxy cluster members using the Bukhari & Cram Method. The Bukhari & Cram Method is a member determination technique that iteratively evaluates membership based on radial velocity and projected distance in the central region. The process is then expanded by increasing the values of Sr and Sv by 10%, ensuring that the new Sr and Sv values are less than the previous ones.
